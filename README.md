# Computational Problem Solving

## Description

Solve a variety of problems through analytical and creative-problem solving skills.

## Course Objectives

This course aims to meet an extensive set of learning objectives with the overall goal of helping you to become more effective programmers through problem solving. After each étude you will see a list of numbers. These refer to skills in the list below, and specify the principal skills that the étude is trying to foster. These are not distributed evenly. Some skills are needed for almost every task and some simply require more attention because they are harder to develop. The most important generic skills are having a good understanding of a problem and working with people and these are therefore implicitly part of the objectives of almost every étude.

### 1. Understanding a problem

1.1 simplifying

1.2 clarifying

1.3 generalising

1.4 specifying

### 2. Problem solving strategies

2.1 lateral and creative approaches to problem solving

2.2 solving problems according to specification

2.3 top-down and bottom-up solution designs

2.4 solving a related problem

2.5 working backwards

2.6 choosing appropriate tools, e.g. pen and paper, spreadsheet, programming language

2.7 applying persistence and thoroughness, removing mental blocks

2.8 appropriate, effective, and creative use of resources (time, personal abilities, library etc.)

2.9 simulation, finding metaphors, trial and error

2.10 designing and using appropriate notation

### 3. Computer related techniques

3.1 understanding the limitations and problems specific to computer program execution (such as overflow, rounding errors, division by zero)

3.2 understanding file formats, platform specifics and proprietary aspects of computing

3.3 understanding recursion and iteration and when and why to use them

3.4 using appropriate data structures, considering suitability, simplicity and size

3.5 adequate testing, debugging and validation

3.6 understanding efficiency, profiling and measuring

3.7 understanding and using fundamental algorithms

### 4. Working with people

4.1 understanding different approaches required in team and individual projects

4.2 becoming aware of group dynamics; identifying different skills of group members, task allocation, participation, conflict resolution

4.3 collaboration and ego-less programming

4.4 working with other people’s programs; reading, understanding, debugging, maintaining, re-using code, libraries

4.5 producing software that is adequately documented, commented, and user-friendly

4.6 an understanding of ethics, and professional responsibilities towards colleagues and clients, including confidentiality and software protection

4.7 recording proceedings, decisions, progress etc.

4.8 writing clear and concise reports
